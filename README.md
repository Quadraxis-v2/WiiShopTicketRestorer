# WiiShopTicketRestorer
This application lets you get back the tickets of your purchased games from the Wii Shop Channel in case you lost them or overwrote them.
If you ever bought a game in the WSC and are now unable to redownload it (e.g. if you deleted it with ATD or reinstalled a fake WAD), run this app and the next time you connect to the shop you will get your legit tickets back!
